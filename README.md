# Fashion

This is a Machine learning / Computer Vision project, based on the Fashion-MNIST dataset (https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist).
The idea of this project is to apply the simplest model ever (linear regression basically) to one of the most complicated tasks, which
is to recognize clothing.

The result is more than 1/3 success rate, which is quite surprising!

To do this I have manually implemented several variants of gradient descent (classic, stochastic, batch, Nesterov, adam, etc.).

The outputs display, for each of these variants, the successive loss function values, and at the end the success rate achieved.
